# Blockchain Business Card

**WARNING**. _This branch is my active development branch for trying to implement nextjs with this project and the NEAR API. check out the main branch. some of the files here are possibly outdated compared to the main branch_.

This is a relatively simple smart contract implemented with a front end.

The contract allows you to _"mint"_ a business card for 5 NEAR.
Things you can do with you business card:

- Add a website.
- Display your NEAR account id.
- Claim blockchain development experience.

Once you declare your blockchain experience, others can then __vouch__ or __refute__ your claims.
Your busines card will display your Net Vouches as a public rating.

I have yet to figure out the economics. This was built for the NEARxEncode Bootcamp Jan 2022.

To run follow the README in [/Contract]("/Contract/README.md) first and then [/frontend]("/frontend/README.md").
