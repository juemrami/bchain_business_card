# Blockchain Business Card
This is a relatively simple smart contract to be implemented with a front end soon.

The contract allows you to _"mint"_ a business card for 5 NEAR.
Things you can do with you business card:
- Add a website.
- Display your NEAR account id.
- Claim blockchain development experience.

Once you declare your blockchain experience, others can then __vouch__ or __refute__ your claims.
Your busines card will display your Net Vouches as a public rating.

I have yet to figure out the economics. This was built for the NEARxEncode Bootcamp Jan 2022.
