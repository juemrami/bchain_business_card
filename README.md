# Blockchain Business Card

This is a relatively simple smart contract implemented with a front end.

The contract allows you to _"mint"_ a business card for 5 NEAR.
Things you can do with you business card:

- Add a website.
- Display your NEAR account id.
- Claim blockchain development experience.
- Vouch and/or refute other business card holders personal claims.

All Business Cards will display your Net Vouches as a public rating.

I have yet to figure out the economics. This was built for the NEARxEncode Bootcamp Jan 2022.

To learn about the internals follow the README in [/Contract/](Contract/README.md)

To get started with deploying a contract and starting the fronted check the README [here in /frontend/](frontend/README.md).
