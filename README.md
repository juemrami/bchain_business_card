# Blockchain Business Card
This is a relatively simple smart contract to implemented with a front end soon.

The contract allows you to 'mint' a business card for 5 NEAR.
Things you can do with you business card:
- add a website
- display your near id
- add blockchain dev experience

Once you declare your blockchain experience, others can then __vouch__ or __refute__ your claims.
your busines card will display your Net Vouches as a public rating.

I have yet to figure out the economics. This was build for the NEARxEncode Bootcamp Jan 2022.
