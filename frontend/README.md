# Devlog

## Todo:
    x add error catching inside of provider 
    x add view functions to provider
    - implement propper typings for callFunction's
    - better handling of error/loading states (maybe use a stack or queue to track)
    - add loading spinners per component vs page.
    - implement contract log indexing w/ graphql
  
# This Frontend Was Created Using Nextjs

Before you run any scripts i encourage you to follow the [`README.md`](/frontend/contract/README.md) inside of the `/frontend/contract` directory.

or... TLDR. do the following:

_from within the `frontend/contract/` directory..._

1. run `./dev-deploy.sh`

2. run `near call $CONTRACT new --accountId $CONTRACT` with the proper `$CONTRACT` set.

3. Set the proper contract account name in the `frontend/.env` file.

4. run 'yarn install'

5. run 'yarn start'
