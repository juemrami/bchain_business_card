# These scripts were created with the [near-sdk-as Starter Kit](https://github.com/Learn-NEAR/starter--near-sdk-as)

__0__. (__OPTIONAL__. The next step runs this same command this is just for insight on whats going on)
Run the build-contract.sh command from the within this directory.

    `./build-contract.sh`

    This builds the webasembly file `contract.wasm` and places it in the `frontend/contract/wasm32_out/` folder. Check out the script to see exactly what is does [here](../../Contract/build.sh).

    *Note. This webassembly in reality has nothing to do with the function of the front end directly. That is your when your frontend is communicating the backend, it is never using these wasm files directly. These files are instead used for the Near CLI to be abble to deploy a Smart Contract onto an account on the blockchain. This account is what is executing your "backend" logic (really its executing it on the client side via wasm)*

__1__. Run the dev-deploy.sh script to execute the Near CLI commands that deploy the contract onto a development account generated by the Near CLI itself. Follow the script instructions careufully.

    `./dev-deploy.sh`

    Once you have followed all the instructions and set your $CONTRACT workspace variable correctly (you check with `echo $CONTRACT`) run.

    `near call $CONTRACT new --accountId $CONTRACT`

    This will call the `new()` method on the smart contract deployed onto the account created by the `dev-deploy.sh` script. 

    By passing in the same contract account name (ie `$CONTRACT`) as the `--acountId` argument, the contract invokes itself and is its own owner saved on the `ownder_id` feild of contract stores main struct.

__2.__ Before You can build the frontend we have to set the correct `.env` variable for the account id the contract is deployed onto. You can see workspace varaible you set for the contract account id with `echo $CONTRACT`. There should also be new folder generated in this directory called `/neardev/` with the account id as well.

    Make sure the correct contract account id is set on the `REACT_APP_CONTRACT_NAME` environment variable within [`frontend/.env`](../.env)

    Also make sure that your terminal is in the `/frontend/` directory before running these next commands. Run.
  
    `yarn install`

    and

    `yarn start`
